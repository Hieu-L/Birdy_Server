# Birdy_Social_Media

![alt text](https://github.com/Hieu-L/Birdy_Social_Media/blob/main/screenshot.png?raw=true)

This is my implementation of a social media website inspired from Twitter, developed with Gabriella Rakotoarison.

Together, we developped both a client side using React js and a server with REST API. The database used in this project is MongoDB.
